To make a file of random numbers, I used the command:
	$ od -An -N1600000 -t f8 ./urandom | sed s/" "/"\n"/g | tr -s "\n" > /home/jon/nums.txt

In the folder /dev/
The arguments:
	-An removes the addresses that od normally outputs
	-N1600000 states that it is 1.6 million bytes
	-t f8 make it so it's an 8-byte floating numbers
	./urandom randomizes

	sed s/" "/"\n"/g - replaces spaces with newlines
	tr -s "\n" removes all duplicates of newlines

To check the time speeds, I logged into the seasnet acct and used the following command:
	$ /usr/bin/time -p /usr/local/cs/bin/sort -g --parallel=N < nums.txt > /dev/null
where N is the number of threads to run at once.
I ran this command in the directory where my nums.txt is.

I got the following results:1
For 1 thread:
	real 3.71
	user 3.71
	sys 0.00

For 2 threads:
	real 2.01
	user 3.79
	sys 0.00

For 4 threads:
	real 1.32
	user 4.03
	sys 0.01

For 8 threads:
	real 0.97
	user 4.40
	sys 0.02

From looking at that, the more threads, the quicker the sort function works.
The speed is not exactly proportional to the number of threads, but that can be the cause of Amdahl's Law.
The real speed goes down every time, but the user speed actually goes up.
Using more threads will require more user buffer.
