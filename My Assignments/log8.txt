#Lab 8

For this lab, I acted as the client.
My friend was the host and created the server by typing:
	$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

As a client, I needed to create a public key and send it to the host.
To create the public key, I used the following command:
	$ ssh-keygen

To copy the key to the host, I had to type the following command:
	$ scp /home/jon/.ssh/id_rsa.pub name@ipaddress:.ssh/authorized_keys
This would send the key to the host.

After this, I had to ssh to the server:
	$ ssh name@ipaddress

While in the server, I had to add the public key to the list of authorized keys.
I used the command:
	$ cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

I exited the ssh:
	$ exit

I tried to use port forwarding by using the command:
	$ ssh -X name@ipaddress

Typing 
	$ xterm 
created a new window
