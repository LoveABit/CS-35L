Q1. The extra "case_long_iso_time_style:" seems like it was type,
because there was a "case long_iso_time_style:" in the line before it.
I don't think it was necessary to remove the line, but it didn't
hurt to take it out.

Q2. If other countries use this version of Coreutils, the month 
may not be the same in other languages other than English. If 
there was a way to make the months something familiar to the 
other languages, that should fix the problem. Other than that, 
even if other counties aren't familiar with the 
American-formatted dates, the day and year seems self explanatory, 
and it shouldn't be hard to understand.

Q3. If you run the script on /dev/null, it will output an error 
because it is not able to find a random line in an empty file.
Because the file is empty, the program can't select any line from it.
