download coreutils 8.0
unzip it and inside the folder, ./configure && make 
	to create the source files
create a test directory to test the rm command
	mkdir test
	cd test
	touch ./-ooops a b c
	../src/rm *
you should see the error:
	rm: invalid option -- 'o'
	Try `rm ./-ooops' to remove the file `-ooops'.
	Try `rm --help' for more information.
the objective is to get rid of the 2nd line to get
	rm: invalid option -- 'o'
	Try `rm --help' for more information.
by unpatching the patch given to us 
- I tried to use the patch command to undo the patch, 
	but couldn't find the correct flags to succesfully
	unpatch the patch given. The flags that were able to unpatch
	correctly was "-R". "--dry-run" also helped to show what 
	would have outputted if the command was run, without actually
	running it.
	The problem is that the code was changed after the patch
	was applied, and sometimes it tried to remove lines that 
	no longer existed.
	The 1st and 3rd patch seemed to work (to unpatch), but the
	2nd and 4th patches weren't able to unpatch.The 2nd was 
	understandable because it was trying to remove a line that
	wasn't there.
after manually deleting the lines that have a "+" in the patch,
	I used the make command in the root directory to get the
	new rm.
	Testing it again in coreutils/test, it now outputs the desired
	error. (The second line no longer exists in the error)
Use an old version of rm.c ("rm.c.orig") and the new modified rm.c
	use "diff -u rm.c.orig rm.c > lab4.diff" command to create a file
	that is the difference between the two files. This creates a patch
	file that basically removes the lines we don't want anymore.
	Do the same thing with NEWS with the command:
	"diff -u NEWS.orig NEWS >> lab4.diff " where NEWS.orig is the original 
	NEWS before the "unpatch" was applied. It's important to do this in
	the root directory so it knows that rm.c is in the src directory.
