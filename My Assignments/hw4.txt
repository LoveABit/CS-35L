create a folder in my home directory (where you work from)
	"cvsroot"
use the following command to make it a cvs repo:
	"cvs -d ~/cs35l/lab4/cvsroot init"
go inside the coreutils and use the command
	"cvs -d ~/cs35l/lab4/cvsroot import coreutils coreutils ver_1"
go back to the home directory and commit it
	"cvs commit"
this will create a "coreutil" folder in the home directory
that's where you want to work to save changes to the repo
go to the coreutil (not coreutil-8.0) folder, and run the patch
	"patch -p0 < lab4.diff"
after that, commit again. this will create a revision "1.2" (the old one was "1.1")
now you have to compare the two revisions with cvs diff:
	"cvs diff -u -r 1.2 -r 1.1 > hw4.patch"
this will create a patch file that shows the difference between the revisions
test the patch by using the patch command, and then checking 1.3 to 1.1, and there
	should be no difference.
