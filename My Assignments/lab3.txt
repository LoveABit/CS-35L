downloaded coreutils 7.6 from the website
checked locale to make sure it was what I wanted
used the coreutil 7.6 ls command to see what it outputted.
	it outputted the output in YYYY-MM-DD format
looked through patch page and looked for the patch
copied the patch into a document
	the patch starts at @@, but you can copy before it
going in coreutil directory, typed ./configure && make
it should make the source files for everything, including ls
move the patch file into the the coreutil directory,
	then use the patch command (patch -p1 < my.patch)
	-p1 is to ignore "a/" and "b/" from the source
the new ls should work
