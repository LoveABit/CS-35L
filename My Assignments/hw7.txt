The following are listed from most urgent to least urgent:

1. VU#945216 (2001-10-24) SSH CRC32 attack detection code contains remote integer overflow
This threat seemed to be the most harmful, because it affected the most systems. Also, it was possible to hack any SSH daemon by sending it a certain packet, so any system can potentially be hacked remotely, which makes it even more dangerous.

2. VU#507652 (2010-04-02) Oracle Sun Java fails to properly validate Java applet signatures
This threat seemed more serious than the rest, because it would be hard to know if the alowed applets had a change in code. I think this one is one of the hardest for a normal user to actually catch, and there is a lot of potential damage that can happen.

3. VU#943165 (2010-05-10) Apple Safari window object invalid pointer vulnerability
This one seems a bit harder to exploit because it has to due with a specific browser, and it isn't that popular compared to the other ones.  
Because it's through Javascript, and pretty much every computer uses it, it seems like a higher threat than the other two.

4. VU#964549 (2010-03-23) Mozilla WOFF decoder integer overflow
This threat didn't seem as harmful as the other ones because it requires a certain browser, and it requires someone to supply a malicious Web Open Fonts Format file to exploit the vulnerability. It's easy to stop Firefox from downloading remote fonts, and that will prevent anything bad to happen to the system.

5. VU#886582 (2010-04-19) Java Deployment Toolkit insufficient argument validation
This was seemed to be the least urgent because it requires a "specially crafted HTML document" and the victum would have to visit it. With the security now, it seems like seeing that a website is malicious is pretty easy. The potential threat of this does not seem very high.
