1. If another team has been observing the bytes going across the network, the
resulting network is still secure because the "hacker" wouldn't be able to do
anything with the public key. Without the correct private key, the hacker wouldn't
be able to do anything on the host.

If your team already has the keys generated, and if another team tapped the keystrokes,
the server should still safe because there would be no need for typing passwords 
of any sort. On the other hand, if the keys were not generated yet, there would be 
a need to type in the password, and the other team would get that password. 

The weakness of the setup would only occur during the setup. If another team gets the
password, that would cause potential problems. Once we get our keys, everything should
be fine.

2. The --verify command doesn't really verify that I personally created it because
 it's possible for someone else to have his public key inside my archive, and he could
 then sign it with his own private key. Using the --verify command would say it's
 good, but it won't say if I actually signed it or if a "hacker" did. For example, if
 someone else was turning in my homework for me, he/she would sign it with his/her
 public and private keys, and --verify would say it's okay.
